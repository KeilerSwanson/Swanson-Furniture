		quote: `Scott is a true craftsman and it's what sold me on going with him. He was prompt to every appointment and was communicative regarding when he would be finished with the work and ready to install. The final product was exactly as discussed and even had some personal touches that truly made it one of a kind. Exactly what I was hoping for. Something not cookie cutter. He was willing to go as fancy as we wanted, but stuck to his value:cost mantra which worked really well for my wife and I. Overall a great experience. I will be hiring Scott again for other custom work I plan to have done. Thanks Scott!`,
